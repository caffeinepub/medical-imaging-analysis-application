However, no frontend files were modified — the ApiConfigDialog component, Header 'API Config' button (REQ-2), and Footer component (REQ-3) are all missing from the diff.",

      "reason": "No frontend files were added or modified in the diff. There is no evidence of an ApiConfigDialog component, no Header changes showing an 'API Config' button, and no frontend form validation or password-masked key input.",
